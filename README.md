## SUMMARY 
The aim of the 3rd Year Datalogger Project is to teach students how to develop a modern embedded 
system including hardware and firmware/software components.  The overall project time is 4 weeks, 
whereby students summarise design specifications in an interim report after 2 weeks, and 
demonstrate a full working system after 4 weeks, followed by the submission of a final report.  
The project uses an Arduino UNO microcontroller board which is based on the ATmega328P 
microcontroller unit (MCU). There are 4 main parts which require design in this project. Firstly, the 
students have to design circuitry for taking the input signal(s) and interfacing it with the MCU. Next, 
students will have to write firmware (in C) to control the MCU and to handle input from the circuitry. 
Then, there are the ‘Communications’ and ‘Software’ aspects, which are in essence the protocol or 
format with which data or commands are sent between the MCU and the Windows PC. For their 
overall system, students will have to develop a "product identity" in the form of a marketing datasheet 
to create an awareness of the commercial market in the target area. To create cost awareness, the 
students will have a budget of £15 available to purchase hardware components that are not available 
in the teaching lab. 
Students will start by going through an introductory handout on the operation of the Arduino. 
Additional reading material will also be provided on more advanced features of the microcontroller 
board which the students might choose to incorporate in their designs.
